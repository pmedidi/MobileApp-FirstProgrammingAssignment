# Welcome to the Travel Companion Expo App! üåç‚úàÔ∏è

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## About the App

**Travel Companion** is an application that allows users to plan trips and explore attractions in their destination city. Follow these steps to make the most out of this app:

### 1. Add a Travel Plan:
- Navigate to the **Add Plan** page.
- Enter the **city**, **state**, and **country** you plan to visit.
- Ensure there are no spelling mistakes in the city, state, or country, as this can affect the search functionality.

### 2. View Your Itinerary:
- After adding your travel plan, go to the **Itinerary** page.
- You‚Äôll see the destinations you‚Äôve entered.
- Select a city from your itinerary and **click "Explore"** to view attractions in that area.

### 3. Explore Attractions:
- Once you‚Äôve selected a destination from the **Itinerary** page, navigate to the **Explore** page.
- This will show you nearby attractions based on the destination you selected.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**:
You must first visit the **Itinerary** page and select a destination before going to the **Explore** page.  
**If you go to the Explore page without selecting a destination, the app will crash because there will be no location data to search for attractions.**
