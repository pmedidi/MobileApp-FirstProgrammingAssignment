# Welcome to the Travel Companion Expo App! üåç‚úàÔ∏è

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## About the App

Travel Companion is an application that allows users to plan trips and explore attractions in the destination city. Follow these steps to make the most out of this app:

1. **Add a Travel Plan**:  
   - Navigate to the **Add Plan** page.
   - Enter the **city**, **state**, and **country** you plan to visit.
   - Make sure not to misspell the city, state, or country, as it will affect the search functionality later.

2. **View Your Itinerary**:  
   - After adding your travel plan, go to the **Itinerary** page.
   - You‚Äôll see the destinations you‚Äôve entered.
   - Select a city from your itinerary and **click "Explore"** to view attractions in that area.

3. **Explore Attractions**:  
   - Once you‚Äôve selected a destination from the **Itinerary** page, go to the **Explore** page.
   - This will show you nearby attractions based on the destination you selected.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**:  
You must first visit the **Itinerary** page and select a destination before going to the **Explore** page.  
**If you go to the Explore page without selecting a destination, the app will crash because there will be no location data to search for attractions.**

## Get Started

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash

2. **Start The App**:
